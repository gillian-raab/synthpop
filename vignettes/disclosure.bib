 abstract = {Protection against disclosure is important for statistical agencies releasing microdata files from sample surveys. Simple measures of disclosure risk can provide useful evidence to support decisions about release. We propose a new measure of disclosure risk: the probability that a unique match between a microdata record and a population unit is correct. We argue that this measure has at least two advantages. First, we suggest that it may be a more realistic measure of risk than two measures that are currently used with census data. Second, we show that consistent inference (in a specified sense) may be made about this measure from sample data without strong modelling assumptions. This is a surprising finding, in its contrast with the properties of the two 'similar' established measures. As a result, this measure has potentially useful applications to sample surveys. In addition to obtaining a simple consistent predictor of the measure, we propose a simple variance estimator and show that it is consistent. We also consider the extension of inference to allow for certain complex sampling schemes. We present a numerical study based on 1991 census data for about 450 000 enumerated individuals in one area of Great Britain. We show that the theoretical results on the properties of the point predictor of the measure of risk and its variance estimator hold to a good approximation for these data.},

abstract="Most statistical agencies release randomly selected samples of Census microdata, usually with sample fractions under 10{\%} and with other forms of statistical disclosure control (SDC) applied. An alternative to SDC is data synthesis, which has been attracting growing interest, yet there is no clear consensus on how to measure the associated utility and disclosure risk of the data. The ability to produce synthetic Census microdata, where the utility and associated risks are clearly understood, could mean that more timely and wider-ranging access to microdata would be possible.",

abstract="The United States Internal Revenue Service Statistics of Income (SOI) Division possesses invaluable administrative tax data from individual income tax returns that could vastly expand our understanding of how tax policies affect behavior and how those policies could be made more effective. However, only a small number of government analysts and researchers can access the raw data. The public use file (PUF) that SOI has produced for more than 60 years has become increasingly difficult to protect using traditional statistical disclosure control methods. The vast amount of personal information available in public and private databases combined with enormous computational power create unprecedented disclosure risks. SOI and researchers at the Urban Institute are developing synthetic data that represent the statistical properties of the administrative data without revealing any individual taxpayer information. This paper presents quality estimates of the first fully synthetic PUF and shows how it performs in tax model microsimulations as compared with the PUF and the confidential administrative data.",
